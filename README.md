## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media queries for responsive design

### What I learned

This project helped me practice responsive design across three breakpoints (desktop, tablet, and mobile). Key takeaways:

- **Responsive images**: Used different image sources for different screen sizes using CSS `display` properties and media queries
- **Flexbox layouts**: Built the header and footer sections using Flexbox for alignment and spacing
- **Mobile-first adjustments**: Implemented media queries at 768px and 375px to adapt the layout for smaller screens
- **Background images**: Used CSS background properties with overlays for the footer section

```css
/* Example of responsive hero image swap */
.hero-image {
  display: none;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .hero-image {
    display: block;
  }
  .image {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

Areas I want to continue focusing on:

- CSS Grid for more complex layouts
- CSS animations and transitions
- Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
